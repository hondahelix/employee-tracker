## Installation

The installation of this project is to access my github repository and then click on employee-tracker or click this link [employee-tracker](https://github.com/hondahelix/employee-tracker) then click on the green code button in the top right corner. Then you can copy and paste the code via ssh or by downloading a zip file. Once you have downloaded the file there are a couple of things that must be downloaded in order for this application to run properly. The first is node.js once this is downloaded open up the terminal and navigate to the file that this project is saved in. Then run the code:
npm i 
After that copy the seed.sql file into mysql and run the code. This will create a database. Furthermore, the password will need to be changed to match the password for your mysql. Then all that is left to do is run the command:
node app.js.
